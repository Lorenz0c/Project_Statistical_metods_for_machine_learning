# Project_Statistical_metods_for_machine_learning

This is the project realized as part of the exam of the Statistical methods for machine learning course of Universit√† degli studi di Milano (accademic year 2019-2020).

The main purpose of the project was to learn to implement Neural Networks and in particular Convolutional Neural Networks, observing how the results of the learning changes with the changes in the number of layers of the network and in the number of neurons per layer.

The networks have to learn to recognise different fruit contained in the images of the dataset used.
